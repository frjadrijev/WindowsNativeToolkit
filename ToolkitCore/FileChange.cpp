/// <summary>
/// Auto-generated implementation file for the FileChange Windows Runtime component.
/// This file includes the generated factory methods and activation support.
/// 
/// The generated code provides:
/// - Default constructor implementation
/// - Factory method winrt_make_ToolkitCore_FileChange for creating instances
/// - WinRT activation and projection support
/// - Type registration with the Windows Runtime system
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This file should not be modified directly as it contains generated code.
/// All custom implementation should be placed in FileChange.h.
/// 
/// The included FileChange.g.cpp file contains:
/// - Activation factory registration
/// - Interface implementation helpers
/// - Property getter/setter implementations that delegate to the header
/// - Reference counting and lifetime management
/// </remarks>
#include "FileChange.g.cpp"    // ← this provides FileChange() and winrt_make_ToolkitCore_FileChange
