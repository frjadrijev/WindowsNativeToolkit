    /// <summary>
    /// Implementation of the FileWatcherService Windows Runtime component.
    /// Provides a managed wrapper around native Win32 file system monitoring
    /// capabilities, exposing them through a clean WinRT interface.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class bridges the gap between low-level Win32 file monitoring APIs
    /// and the higher-level Windows Runtime event model. It manages the lifetime
    /// of native resources and ensures proper cleanup when the service is stopped
    /// or the object is destroyed.
    /// 
    /// Runtime component characteristics:
    /// Windows Runtime component that provides file system monitoring capabilities.
    /// Watches folders for changes and raises events through delegate pattern.
    /// The FileWatcherService uses the Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW API internally
    /// to provide efficient, asynchronous file system monitoring. It supports monitoring
    /// of subdirectories and provides detailed change information including timestamps
    /// and change types.
    /// 
    /// Architecture:
    /// - Uses composition to delegate actual monitoring to FileWatcherNative
    /// - Provides event marshaling from native callbacks to WinRT events
    /// - Implements weak reference pattern to prevent circular references
    /// - Thread-safe event handling with proper synchronization
    /// 
    /// Usage pattern:
    /// 1. Create an instance of FileWatcherService
    /// 2. Subscribe to the Changed event
    /// 3. Call Start() with the folder path to monitor
    /// 4. Handle change events as they occur
    /// 5. Call Stop() when monitoring is no longer needed
    /// 
    /// Performance considerations:
    /// - Monitoring large directory trees may impact performance
    /// - Event frequency depends on file system activity
    /// - Consider filtering events based on your application's needs
    /// 
    /// Lifecycle:
    /// 1. Construction creates the service in stopped state
    /// 2. Start() begins monitoring and activates the native watcher
    /// 3. File changes trigger callbacks that fire WinRT events
    /// 4. Stop() cleanly shuts down monitoring and releases resources
    /// 5. Destruction automatically stops monitoring if still active
    /// </remarks>

        /// Implementation details:
        /// - Delegates to the native watcher's Start method with folder path
        /// - Creates internal callback that converts native events to WinRT events
        /// - Uses weak reference pattern to prevent circular references
        /// - Creates projected FileChange objects from native change data
        /// - Fires WinRT events with proper lifetime management
        /// 
        /// Event handling architecture:
        /// - Internal callback uses get_weak() to avoid strong references that could
        ///   prevent proper cleanup
        /// - If the service is destroyed when a callback fires, the weak reference
        ///   returns null and the event is silently ignored
        /// - Native FileChange objects are converted to projected WinRT FileChange objects
        /// - WinRT Changed event is fired with this service as sender and change data
        /// 
        /// Thread safety:
        /// - Method execution is thread-safe through atomic operations in native layer
        /// - Event callbacks are fired on background monitoring thread
        /// - Weak reference pattern ensures safe cleanup during destruction
