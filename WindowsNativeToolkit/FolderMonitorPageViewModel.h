    /// <summary>
    /// Implementation class for the FolderMonitorPageViewModel Windows Runtime component.
    /// Provides the business logic and data binding support for file system monitoring
    /// functionality following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class serves as the ViewModel component in the MVVM pattern, encapsulating
    /// business logic and providing a clean, testable interface between the UI and
    /// the underlying file system monitoring services.
    /// 
    /// Runtime class characteristics:
    /// This runtime class encapsulates the business logic for file system monitoring
    /// and provides a clean, bindable interface for the associated view. Key responsibilities:
    /// 
    /// Data management:
    /// - Maintains current folder path state
    /// - Provides property change notifications for UI updates
    /// - Manages file system monitoring service integration
    /// - Handles asynchronous operations and state updates
    /// 
    /// Architecture responsibilities:
    /// - Manages folder path state and validation
    /// - Coordinates with ToolkitCore file monitoring services
    /// - Provides PropertyChanged notifications for data binding
    /// - Handles asynchronous file system events and updates
    /// - Maintains clean separation between UI and business logic
    /// 
    /// MVVM pattern implementation:
    /// - Exposes bindable properties for UI consumption
    /// - Isolates business logic from view-specific concerns
    /// - Enables unit testing of business logic without UI dependencies
    /// - Supports multiple view implementations for the same data
    /// 
    /// Data binding integration:
    /// - Implements INotifyPropertyChanged through [bindable] IDL attribute
    /// - Supports compiled binding (x:DataType) for performance
    /// - Provides thread-safe property updates with UI marshaling
    /// - Enables reactive UI updates based on business logic changes
    /// - [bindable] attribute generates INotifyPropertyChanged implementation
    /// - Automatic PropertyChanged event firing for property setters
    /// - Support for one-way and two-way binding scenarios
    /// - Integration with WinUI compiled binding for performance
    /// 
    /// Service integration:
    /// - Uses ToolkitCore.FileWatcherService for actual monitoring
    /// - Translates low-level file events to high-level UI concepts
    /// - Manages service lifecycle and resource cleanup
    /// - Provides error handling and user-friendly status updates
    /// 
    /// Threading model:
    /// - Property access is UI-thread safe
    /// - File system events handled on background threads
    /// - PropertyChanged events automatically marshaled to UI thread
    /// - Weak reference patterns prevent circular references
    /// - Background operations coordinate with UI through proper dispatching
    /// - Thread-safe integration with file system monitoring services
    /// 
    /// Memory management:
    /// - Uses WinRT reference counting for automatic cleanup
    /// - Weak references for event handlers prevent memory leaks
    /// - Service resources properly disposed when ViewModel is destroyed
    /// - Thread-safe cleanup coordination
    /// </remarks>
