    /// <summary>
    /// Implementation class for the FolderMonitorPage Windows Runtime component.
    /// Provides the user interface for file system monitoring functionality with
    /// integrated ViewModel support following MVVM architectural patterns.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class serves as the View component in the Model-View-ViewModel pattern,
    /// providing a dedicated page for file system monitoring functionality. It inherits
    /// from Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page to provide standard page capabilities and
    /// integrates with the application's navigation framework.
    /// 
    /// Key features:
    /// - Inherits standard WinUI Page functionality (navigation, lifecycle, theming)
    /// - Integrated ViewModel for MVVM pattern implementation
    /// - Data binding support for reactive UI updates
    /// - File system monitoring capabilities through ViewModel integration
    /// - Responsive design that adapts to different window sizes
    /// 
    /// MVVM Integration:
    /// - Maintains reference to associated ViewModel
    /// - Sets DataContext for XAML data binding
    /// - Separates UI logic from business logic
    /// - Uses data binding to connect UI elements to ViewModel properties
    /// - Enables testable and maintainable code architecture
    /// 
    /// Page lifecycle:
    /// - Constructor performs minimal setup
    /// - Initialize() method handles ViewModel creation and binding
    /// - XAML loading deferred per WinUI best practices
    /// - ViewModel creation and binding handled automatically
    /// - Automatic cleanup when page is navigated away
    /// 
    /// Navigation integration:
    /// - Compatible with Frame.Navigate() for type-safe navigation
    /// - Supports navigation parameters for configuration
    /// - Integrates with application navigation history
    /// - Follows standard WinUI page navigation patterns
    /// 
    /// Data binding:
    /// - Uses compiled binding (x:DataType) for performance
    /// - Automatic UI updates via PropertyChanged notifications
    /// - Type-safe property access with compile-time verification
    /// - Support for complex data scenarios and collections
    /// 
    /// Threading considerations:
    /// - UI operations execute on main thread
    /// - ViewModel operations may involve background threads
    /// - Automatic marshaling for PropertyChanged events
    /// - Thread-safe ViewModel updates through dispatcher
    /// - Automatic thread marshaling for data binding updates
    /// - Thread-safe integration with file monitoring services
    /// 
    /// Performance characteristics:
    /// - Lightweight View with logic delegated to ViewModel
    /// - Efficient data binding with compiled expressions
    /// - Minimal UI thread blocking through proper async patterns
    /// - Memory-efficient through proper disposal patterns
    /// </remarks>

        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// Construction sequence:
        /// 1. Base class construction (FolderMonitorPageT)
        /// 2. Initialize() call for ViewModel setup
        /// 3. XAML loading deferred until after construction
        /// 
        /// Construction responsibilities:
        /// - Initializes base Page class functionality
        /// - Creates and configures the associated ViewModel
        /// - Sets up data binding context for XAML integration
        /// - Prepares page for navigation and user interaction
        /// 
        /// This pattern ensures proper COM activation and prevents issues
        /// that can occur when XAML elements access parent objects during
        /// construction. The Initialize() method handles ViewModel creation
        /// and DataContext binding after construction is complete.
        /// 
        /// The constructor follows WinUI recommendations by performing minimal work
        /// and deferring heavy initialization until after construction is complete.
        /// This pattern ensures proper COM activation and prevents issues that can
        /// occur when XAML elements access parent objects during construction.
        /// 
        /// Typical usage scenarios:
        /// - Navigation system creating page instances
        /// - Direct instantiation for testing or embedding
        /// - Factory creation through WinRT activation
        /// 
        /// Post-construction initialization:
        /// - XAML loading handled by framework
        /// - ViewModel binding established automatically
        /// - Page ready for display and interaction
        /// 
        /// See WinUI documentation for details on XAML construction patterns:
