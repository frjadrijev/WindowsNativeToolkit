    /// Implementation class for the MainWindow Windows Runtime component.
    /// Provides the main application window with navigation capabilities and
    /// serves as the primary entry point for user interaction.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class implements the MainWindow runtime class defined in MainWindow.idl
    /// and provides the code-behind functionality for MainWindow.xaml. It inherits
    /// from the auto-generated MainWindowT base class which provides the WinRT
    /// infrastructure and XAML integration.
    /// 
    /// Design responsibilities:
    /// - Window lifecycle management and initialization
    /// - Navigation coordination between different application views
    /// - Event handling for user interactions
    /// - Integration with the application's navigation framework
    /// 
    /// XAML Integration:
    /// The class is bound to MainWindow.xaml through the x:Class attribute,
    /// enabling automatic event handler binding and named element access.
    /// The InitializeComponent() method (generated) loads and processes the XAML.
    /// 
    /// Threading considerations:
    /// - All methods execute on the UI thread unless otherwise noted
    /// - Event handlers are automatically marshaled to the UI thread
    /// - Navigation operations are synchronous and UI-thread bound
    /// 
    /// Memory management:
    /// - Uses WinRT reference counting for automatic lifetime management
    /// - XAML elements are automatically cleaned up when window is closed
    /// - Inherits standard Window disposal patterns from base class
    /// </remarks>

        /// Initializes the window but defers XAML loading per WinUI best practices.
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// Construction pattern follows WinUI recommendations:
        /// - Constructor performs minimal initialization
        /// - XAML loading is deferred until after construction completes
        /// - InitializeComponent() should be called explicitly when ready
        /// 
        /// This pattern prevents COM activation issues that can occur when
        /// XAML elements try to access the parent window during construction.
        /// 
        /// Typical activation flow:
        /// 1. Constructor creates the window instance
        /// 2. Caller invokes InitializeComponent() to load XAML
        /// 3. Window is ready for display and interaction
        ///

        /// - Uses the Frame.Navigate() method for type-safe page navigation

        /// - Automatically handles page lifecycle (construction, initialization)
        /// - Supports navigation history and back navigation patterns
        /// 
        /// Error handling:
        /// - Navigation failures are handled by the Frame control
        /// - Type safety is ensured at compile time through xaml_typename
        /// - Memory management is automatic through WinRT reference counting
        /// 
        /// Performance considerations:
        /// - Page instances are created on-demand during navigation
        /// - Previous pages may be cached by the Frame control
        /// - Consider page disposal patterns for resource-intensive pages
        /// 
        /// Extension points:
        /// - Could be extended to support navigation parameters
        /// - Can be modified to include navigation guards or validation

    /// - XAML markup instantiation via x:Class
    /// - Programmatic creation via winrt::make<MainWindow>()
    /// - WinRT activation APIs (less common for UI components)
