    /// Implementation class for the MainWindow Windows Runtime component.
    /// Provides the main application window with navigation capabilities and
    /// serves as the primary entry point for user interaction.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class implements the MainWindow runtime class defined in MainWindow.idl
    /// and provides the code-behind functionality for MainWindow.xaml. It inherits
    /// from the auto-generated MainWindowT base class which provides the WinRT
    /// infrastructure and XAML integration.
    /// 
    /// Runtime class characteristics:
    /// This runtime class serves as the main entry point for user interaction and houses
    /// the primary navigation infrastructure for the application. It inherits all standard
    /// window capabilities from Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window including:
    /// - Window lifecycle management (show, hide, close)
    /// - Title bar and system integration
    /// - Content hosting and layout management
    /// - Standard window events and input handling
    /// - Theme and styling support
    /// 
    /// Design responsibilities:
    /// - Window lifecycle management and initialization
    /// - Navigation coordination between different application views
    /// - Event handling for user interactions
    /// - Integration with the application's navigation framework
    /// 
    /// WinRT integration:
    /// - The [default_interface] attribute designates this as the primary interface
    ///   for the runtime class, which is required for proper XAML integration and
    ///   factory activation
    /// - Inherits from Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window for standard window functionality
    /// - Uses [default_interface] attribute for primary interface designation
    /// - Provides parameterless constructor for activation factory support
    /// 
    /// XAML Integration:
    /// The class is bound to MainWindow.xaml through the x:Class attribute,
    /// enabling automatic event handler binding and named element access.
    /// The InitializeComponent() method (generated) loads and processes the XAML.
    /// The x:Class attribute in MainWindow.xaml references this runtime class,
    /// enabling the XAML markup compiler to generate the appropriate bindings
    /// and event handler connections.
    /// 
    /// Build process integration:
    /// The IDL is processed by the MIDL compiler to generate:
    /// - Type metadata (.winmd files)
    /// - C++/WinRT projection headers
    /// - Factory implementation templates
    /// - Activation support code
    /// 
    /// Threading considerations:
    /// - All methods execute on the UI thread unless otherwise noted
    /// - Event handlers are automatically marshaled to the UI thread
    /// - Navigation operations are synchronous and UI-thread bound
    /// 
    /// Memory management:
    /// - Uses WinRT reference counting for automatic lifetime management
    /// - XAML elements are automatically cleaned up when window is closed
    /// - Inherits standard Window disposal patterns from base class
    /// </remarks>

        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// Construction pattern follows WinUI recommendations:
        /// - Constructor performs minimal initialization
        /// - XAML loading is deferred until after construction completes
        /// - InitializeComponent() should be called explicitly when ready
        /// 
        /// This pattern prevents COM activation issues that can occur when
        /// XAML elements try to access the parent window during construction.
        /// 
        /// WinRT activation scenarios:
        /// This constructor is called by:
        /// - The WinRT activation factory when creating instances
        /// - XAML markup processing when parsing MainWindow.xaml
        /// - Direct instantiation from C++ code using winrt::make
        /// 
        /// The actual initialization logic is implemented in the C++ implementation
        /// class, not in the IDL declaration. The constructor should:
        /// - Initialize base Window class
        /// - Set up initial window properties
        /// - Prepare for XAML content loading
        /// 
        /// Typical activation flow:
        /// 1. Constructor creates the window instance
        /// 2. Caller invokes InitializeComponent() to load XAML
        /// 3. Window is ready for display and interaction
        /// 
        /// Note: XAML controls should not call InitializeComponent() in their
        /// constructor but should defer initialization until after construction
        /// to avoid COM activation issues.

        /// - Uses the Frame.Navigate() method for type-safe page navigation

        /// - Automatically handles page lifecycle (construction, initialization)
        /// - Supports navigation history and back navigation patterns
        /// 
        /// Navigation mechanism:
        /// - Uses contentFrame() to access the named Frame element from XAML
        /// - Calls Navigate() with xaml_typename for type-safe navigation
        /// - xaml_typename<> provides compile-time type checking and runtime type info
        /// 
        /// Page lifecycle:
        /// - FolderMonitorPage is instantiated during navigation
        /// - Page constructor and Initialize() methods are called automatically
        /// - Previous page state is maintained by Frame navigation history
        /// 
        /// Error handling:
        /// - Frame.Navigate() handles navigation failures internally
        /// - Type safety is ensured at compile time through xaml_typename
        /// - Invalid navigation attempts result in no operation (fail-safe)
        /// - Memory management is automatic through WinRT reference counting
        /// 
        /// Performance characteristics:
        /// - Navigation is synchronous and completes immediately
        /// - Page creation overhead is minimal for lightweight pages
        /// - Frame control manages page lifecycle and memory automatically
        /// - Page instances are created on-demand during navigation
        /// - Previous pages may be cached by the Frame control
        /// 
        /// Threading:
        /// - Executes on UI thread (required for XAML operations)
        /// - Event handler is automatically marshaled to UI thread by WinUI
        /// - No additional synchronization required
        /// 
        /// Extension points:
        /// - Could be extended to support navigation parameters via Navigate() overloads
        /// - Can be modified to include navigation guards or validation
        /// - Supports animation and transition customization
        /// - Could implement navigation guards or user confirmation
        /// - Could add navigation analytics or telemetry
        /// - Could support deep linking or external navigation requests
