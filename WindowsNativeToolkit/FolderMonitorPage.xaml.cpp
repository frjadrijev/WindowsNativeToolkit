    /// MVVM setup process:
    /// 1. Creates a new FolderMonitorPageViewModel instance using winrt::make
    /// 2. Assigns the ViewModel to the page's DataContext property
    /// 3. Enables XAML data binding expressions to resolve against ViewModel properties
    /// 4. Establishes the foundation for reactive UI updates
    /// 
    /// DataContext assignment:
    /// - Sets FrameworkElement::DataContext inherited property
    /// - Enables {Binding} expressions in XAML to resolve against ViewModel
    /// - Supports both compiled binding (x:DataType) and traditional binding
    /// - Automatic PropertyChanged event subscription for UI updates
    /// 
    /// ViewModel creation:
    /// - Uses winrt::make for proper WinRT object creation
    /// - Ensures correct reference counting and lifetime management
    /// - Triggers ViewModel constructor and Initialize() sequence
    /// - Sets up file monitoring service integration automatically
    /// 
    /// Design patterns:
    /// - Implements MVVM separation of concerns
    /// - Page (View) delegates business logic to ViewModel
    /// - Clean testability through ViewModel abstraction
    /// - Reusable ViewModel across different view implementations
    /// 
    /// Threading considerations:
    /// - Executes on UI thread (required for DataContext assignment)
    /// - ViewModel initialization may involve background operations
    /// - PropertyChanged events automatically marshaled to UI thread
    /// - Thread-safe ViewModel operations through proper patterns
    /// 
    /// Memory management:
    /// - WinRT reference counting manages ViewModel lifetime
    /// - ViewModel disposed when page is navigated away
    /// - Automatic cleanup of service subscriptions and resources
    /// - Weak reference patterns prevent circular references

    /// - Used by external components to configure ViewModel behavior
    /// - Enables dependency injection and testing scenarios

    /// - Supports navigation parameter passing and state management
    /// 
    /// Usage scenarios:
    /// - Navigation controllers passing parameters to ViewModel
    /// - Parent pages accessing child page state
    /// - Testing frameworks validating ViewModel state
    /// - Dependency injection containers managing ViewModel lifecycle
    /// 
    /// Thread safety:
    /// - noexcept specification guarantees no exceptions thrown
    /// - Safe to call from UI thread (typical usage pattern)
    /// - ViewModel reference is thread-safe through WinRT infrastructure
    /// - Property access should follow ViewModel threading guidelines
    /// 
    /// Lifetime considerations:
    /// - ViewModel lifetime tied to page instance lifecycle
    /// - Returns same instance throughout page lifetime
    /// - Automatic cleanup when page is destroyed or navigated away
    /// - WinRT reference counting ensures proper memory management
    /// 
    /// Performance:
    /// - Simple field access with minimal overhead
    /// - No validation or computation performed
    /// - Safe for frequent access in performance-critical scenarios
    /// - Inline-eligible for optimal code generation
