    /// - Add actual file change processing in event handler
    /// - Implement folder selection UI integration
    /// - Add error handling and user feedback
    /// - Configure monitoring parameters (filters, recursion, etc.)

    /// the null weak reference and ignore the event, preventing crashes.
